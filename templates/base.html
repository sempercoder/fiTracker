<h1>FiTracker: Weight Loss Tool</h1>
<p>
To many tools I see today focus on the wrong elements for healthy weight loss, or if they are actually good programs they cost a lot of money.  The goal of fitracker is to provide an easy to use tool that tracks and graphs the important metrics for a healthy life style.
